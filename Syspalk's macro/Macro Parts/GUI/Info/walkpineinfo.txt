This will let you walk back to the hive instead of rejoining or resetting when you're farming in pinetree.

This can be used to make slightly more honey when macroing with blue, the reason for this is that it takes basically the same amount of time to walk back as to reset meaning that the pollen in your bag will not be wasted.
